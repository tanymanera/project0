                    <p> Maxwell's equations are a set of coupled partial differential equations that,
                    together with the Lorentz force law, form the foundation of classical electromagnetism,
                    classical optics, and electric circuits. The equations provide a mathematical model
                    for electric, optical, and radio technologies, such as power generation, electric
                    motors, wireless communication, lenses, radar etc. Maxwell's equations describe how
                    electric and magnetic fields are generated by charges, currents, and changes of the
                    fields. An important consequence of the equations is that they demonstrate
                    how fluctuating electric and magnetic fields propagate at a constant speed (c) in
                    a vacuum. Known as electromagnetic radiation, these waves may occur at various
                    wavelengths to produce a spectrum of light from radio waves to γ-rays.
                    The equations are named after the physicist and mathematician James Clerk Maxwell,
                    who published an early form of the equations that included the Lorentz force law
                    between 1861 and 1862. Maxwell first used the equations to propose that light is an
                    electromagnetic phenomenon.</p>
                    <p>The equations have two major variants. The microscopic Maxwell equations have universal
                    applicability but are unwieldy for common calculations. They relate the electric and
                    magnetic fields to total charge and total current, including the complicated charges and
                    currents in materials at the atomic scale. The "macroscopic" Maxwell equations define two
                    new auxiliary fields that describe the large-scale behaviour of matter without having to
                    consider atomic scale charges and quantum phenomena like spins. However, their use requires
                    experimentally determined parameters for a phenomenological description of the electromagnetic
                    response of materials.</p>
                    <p>The term "Maxwell's equations" is often also used for equivalent alternative formulations.
                    Versions of Maxwell's equations based on the electric and magnetic potentials are preferred for
                    explicitly solving the equations as a boundary value problem, analytical mechanics, or for use
                    in quantum mechanics. The covariant formulation (on spacetime rather than space and time
                    separately) makes the compatibility of Maxwell's equations with special relativity manifest.
                    Maxwell's equations in curved spacetime, commonly used in high energy and gravitational physics,
                    are compatible with general relativity. In fact, Einstein developed special and general
                    relativity to accommodate the invariant speed of light, a consequence of Maxwell's equations,
                    with the principle that only relative movement has physical consequences.</p>
                    <p>Since the mid-20th century, it has been understood that Maxwell's equations are not exact,
                    but a classical limit of the fundamental theory of quantum electrodynamics.</p>

                    <p>The definitions of charge, electric field, and magnetic field can be altered to simplify
                    theoretical calculation, by absorbing dimensioned factors of \(\epsilon_{0}\) and \(\mu_{0}\) into the units of calculation,
                    by convention. With a corresponding change in convention for the Lorentz force law this yields the
                    same physics, i.e. trajectories of charged particles, or work done by an electric motor. These
                    definitions are often preferred in theoretical and high energy physics where it is natural to take
                    the electric and magnetic field with the same units, to simplify the appearance of the electromagnetic
                    tensor: the Lorentz covariant object unifying electric and magnetic field would then contain components
                    with uniform unit and dimension. Such modified definitions are conventionally used with the Gaussian
                    (CGS) units.</p>
